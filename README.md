# BALDUR

In this repository we provide the code of the **BA**yesian **L**atent **D**ata **U**nified **R**epresentation (BALDUR), a novel Bayesian algorithm designed to deal with multi-modal datasets and small sample sizes in high-dimensional settings while providing explainable solutions. To do so, the proposed model combines within a common latent space the different data views to extract the relevant information to solve the classification task and prune out the irrelevant/redundant features/data views. Furthermore, to provide generalizable solutions in small sample size scenarios, BALDUR efficiently integrates dual kernels over the views with a small sample-to-feature ratio. Finally, its linear nature ensures the explainability of the model outcomes, allowing its use for biomarker identification.

This model was published in: FILL WHEN PUBLISHED.

Also, we provide an explanatory notebook (toy_example.ipynb) with a detailed example of how to use BALDUR.
